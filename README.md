## Instalation of stuff

Install MKL somehow. E.g. add repo via following steps in:
`https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/installing-intel-oneapi-toolkits-via-apt.html`.

And then:
`sudo apt install intel-oneapi-mkl-devel`

Put this into bashrc (or run it each time):
`export MKLROOT="/opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/2021.1.1/"`
